To test this project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Save the code**: Save the provided HTML code in a file named `index.html`.

2. **Open the HTML file in a web browser**: Right-click on the `index.html` file you just created and select "Open with" and then choose your preferred web browser.

3. **Interact with the Todo List**: Once the file is opened in the browser, you should see a Todo List interface with input fields to add tasks. You can start interacting with it by adding tasks, marking them as complete, or deleting them.

4. **Test functionality**: Test the functionality of the Todo List by adding tasks with titles and descriptions, marking them as complete, and deleting them. Ensure that the tasks are stored and displayed correctly.

5. **Check local storage**: You can also check if the tasks are being stored correctly in the browser's local storage. You can do this by inspecting the page (usually by right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" or pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I`), then navigating to the "Application" tab (or "Storage" tab depending on the browser), and looking for the stored tasks under "Local Storage".

6. **Verify responsiveness**: Ensure that the Todo List interface is responsive by resizing the browser window or testing it on different devices (if possible). The use of Tailwind CSS should make the design responsive by default.

By following these steps, you should be able to test the Todo List project implemented in the `index.html` file.
